<h2>Understanding the Educational Landscape</h2>
<p>The educational landscape is complex, encompassing various institutions, policies, and support systems. Parents must familiarize themselves with key components to effectively advocate for their children:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Types of Schools:</strong> Understand the differences between public, private, charter, and homeschooling options available in your area.</li>
